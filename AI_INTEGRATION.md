# AI Integration in SQAL

## Soccer Performance Analysis AI

The system integrates an advanced AI model powered by DeepSeek for analyzing trainee performance and providing position recommendations.

### Overview

The AI system analyzes 34 different performance metrics for each trainee, including:
- Physical attributes (acceleration, agility, balance, etc.)
- Technical skills (ball control, dribbling, passing, etc.)
- Mental attributes (vision, composure, reactions, etc.)
- Goalkeeper-specific skills

### Input Format

The AI receives trainee test results in JSON format with the following metrics:
```json
{
  "acceleration": <value>,
  "agility": <value>,
  "balance": <value>,
  "jumping": <value>,
  "reactions": <value>,
  "sprint_speed": <value>,
  "stamina": <value>,
  "strength": <value>,
  "aggression": <value>,
  "att_position": <value>,
  "composure": <value>,
  "interceptions": <value>,
  "vision": <value>,
  "ball_control": <value>,
  "crossing": <value>,
  "curve": <value>,
  "defensive_awareness": <value>,
  "dribbling": <value>,
  "fk_accuracy": <value>,
  "finishing": <value>,
  "heading_accuracy": <value>,
  "long_passing": <value>,
  "long_shots": <value>,
  "penalties": <value>,
  "short_passing": <value>,
  "shot_power": <value>,
  "sliding_tackle": <value>,
  "standing_tackle": <value>,
  "volleys": <value>,
  "gk_diving": <value>,
  "gk_handling": <value>,
  "gk_kicking": <value>,
  "gk_positioning": <value>,
  "gk_reflexes": <value>
}
```

### Output Format

The AI analyzes the input data and returns a comprehensive evaluation including:
- Ratings (1-99) for each playing position:
  - Forward positions (ST, LW, RW)
  - Midfield positions (CAM, CM, CDM, LM, RM)
  - Defensive positions (LB, RB, CB)
  - Goalkeeper (GK)
- Best recommended position
- Detailed notes about the player's strengths and potential

Example output:
```json
{
  "ST": 85,
  "LW": 82,
  "RW": 82,
  "CAM": 78,
  "CM": 75,
  "CDM": 70,
  "LM": 80,
  "RM": 80,
  "LB": 65,
  "RB": 65,
  "CB": 60,
  "GK": 45,
  "best_position": "ST",
  "notes": "Strong attacking attributes with excellent finishing and positioning. Well-suited for a central striking role."
}
```

### Integration Points

The AI analysis is integrated into several key points in the system:
1. After trainee test completion
2. During club application review
3. For talent identification and development tracking

### Benefits

- Objective evaluation of player potential
- Consistent position recommendations
- Data-driven talent identification
- Standardized assessment across all trainees
- Assists clubs in making informed recruitment decisions

### Technical Implementation

The AI model is implemented using DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities, processing the raw test data through a specialized prompt designed for soccer performance analysis. The system maintains a standardized scale (1-99) across all metrics for consistent evaluation.
